# Finance-Datascience-Porfolio
This repository displays my work in finance and economics datascience for future employers and collaborators.

## Project 1: 
Quantitative Porfolio Management where I demonstrate how to build a portfolio based on Modern Portfolio Theory and explain general concepts related to portfolio optimization.

## Project 2:
Fundamental Stock Analysis where is dig deep in balance sheet analysis and giving stocks in my portfolio score based on Piotroski F-score. 

## Project 3:
Value investing analysis where I screen stocks based on ROE and EPSG then construct a portfolio using the screened stocks with the help of optimization technique developed in project1.

## Project 4:
Using the value investment portfolio in project 3 we calculate the beta and alpha of our porfolio and compare it with the benchmark of S&P 500 index. 

## Project 5:
Technical Stock market analysis and back testing strategy based on technical signals. I hardcode technical features instead of using libraries just for fun.

## Project 6:
I Create simple machine learning trading strategies such as ols, clustering,DNN etc. and backtest them against the becnhmark of buy and hold for currency (EUR/USD).

## Project 7:
Create an eigen portfolio using PCA and then verify the portfolio using hierarchical clustering approach to group the stocks in NASDAQ 100 based on their correlation.  

## Project 8:
I replicate the idea of Ray Dalio's Holy grial of investing to create a Minimally Correlated Portfolio using machine learning.
